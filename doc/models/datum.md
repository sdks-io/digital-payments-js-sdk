| `loc` | [`Loc \| undefined`](../../doc/models/loc.md) | Optional | Object containing address details/elements |
| `mppStationId` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | This is the 5-digit Shell Station ID. Leading ‘0’ should be dropped and only last four digits, should be used. E.G. for ‘00123’, only ‘0123’ should be used and for ‘04567’ only ‘4567’ should be used. |
| `doubleSiteId` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The Mobile Payment Platform recognises a user being located at a Shell Station if their GPS is within 300m of a Shell station. Some locations will return multiple Shell Stations within a 300 meter radius. This is an issue for Mobile Payments as it needs  to accurately identify the station the Customer is located at to ensure the correct pump is released<br><br>In Germany such locations have been identified and each Station has been assigned a unique letter (e.g. A, B, C). These letters are clearly visible at the stations. If a Mobile Payments user is located at such a location, they will need to identify the Station by identifying and specifying the Station’s corresponding letter as part of the refuelling journey.<br><br>The double_site_id is used to store the Stations unique letter/ID value. It’s only populated if/when 1 or more stations are within 300m from this station. |
